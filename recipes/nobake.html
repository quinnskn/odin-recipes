<h1>No-Bake Cookies</h1>

<p>This is a recipe for the best no-bake cookies you've ever had. We had to tweak this recipe initially, as my brother couldn't have the peanut butter that you 
    usually find in these. Over the years, we made a few more changes, and now they are perfected.

<ul>
    <li>Three cups of rolled oats</li>
    <li>Half a cup of milk</li>
    <li>Half a stick of butter</li>
    <li>Half a cup of Nutella (chocolate hazlenut spread)</li>
    <li>Two cups of brown sugar</li>
    <li>A dash of vanilla extract</li>
</ul>

<ol>
    <li>Mix the butter, milk, and sugar in a medium-large saucepan until butter has melted.</li>
    <li>Stir in Nutella until fully melted.</li>
    <li>Allow mixture to simmer, not boil, for at least two minutes, then add in vanilla.</li>
    <li>Roll out wax paper to drop the cookies on soon.</li>
    <li>Mix in oatmeal. Note: If done correctly, this will set FAST. Move very quickly at this stage!</li>
    <li>Using a spoon, drop scoops of cookie mix onto wax/parchment paper.</li>
    <li>Wait until set. (The first ones will likely be ready by the time you've finished. If it doesn't set, just freeze them!)</li>
