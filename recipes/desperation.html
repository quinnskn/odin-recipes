<p>This recipe saved me in college when I was totally out of funds--thus the name of it! As long as you have rice, you can include as many or as few of the other ingredients as you want.</p>

    <li>Beans of choice</li>
    <li>Chicken</li>
    <li>Cream of mushroom</li>
    <li>Rotel</li>
</ul>

<ol>
    <li>Cook rice.</li>
    <li>Mix rice and all other ingredients in a 9x13 pan. Cover with cheese if desired.</li>
    <li>Bake at 350 for fifteen to twenty minutes.</li>
</ol>
