<p>This is a very versatile soup that you can largely put anything in, as long as  you stick to the four pillars of cooking: Heat, Salt, Fat, and Acid.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Chicken</li>
    <li>Rotel</li>
    <li>Crushed tomatoes</li>
    <li>Beans of choice</li>
    <li>Chili crisp</li>
    <li>chicken broth</li>
</ul>

<ol>
    <li>Cube the chicken, then throw in large pot to sear.</li>
    <li>Combine rest of ingredients in pot.</li>
    <li>Add seasonings as desired; note that it'll taste better the longer you let it sit.</li>
</ol>
